What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax, readability, and versatility.\n","Popular because:\n","\n","Easy to learn and write.\n","\n","Huge standard library.\n","\n","Supports multiple paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural).\n","\n","Widely used in web dev, data science, automation, AI/ML, etc.\n","\n","2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n","An interpreter reads and executes code line by line. Python uses an interpreter (like CPython) to convert Python code to machine-readable form at runtime.\n","\n","3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names).\n","Examples: if, else, while, class, def, return, etc\n","\n","4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names. Doing so will raise a SyntaxError.\n","\n","5.What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","* Mutability refers to whether an object can be changed after creation.\n","\n","* Mutable objects: can be changed (e.g., list, dict, set)\n","\n","* Immutable objects: cannot be changed (e.g., int, float, str, tuple).\n","\n","6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","* Lists are designed to allow item updates, additions, and deletions, which makes them mutable.\n","* Tuples are meant for fixed data, so they don’t allow changes, making them immutable.\n","\n","7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","* ==: checks if values are equal.\n","\n","* is: checks if both refer to the same object in memory.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","a = [1, 2]\n","b = [1, 2]\n","a == b  # True\n","a is b  # False\n","\n","8 What are logical operators in Python?\n","Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:\n","and: True if both operands are True.\n","or: True if at least one is True.\n","not: Reverses the result.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another.\n","Example: int(\"10\"), str(25), float(\"5.6\")\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","Implicit casting: Done automatically by Python (e.g., int to float)\n","x = 5\n","y = 2.0\n","z = x + y  # x automatically becomes float\n","x = \"10\"\n","y = int(x)  # Manually converting string to int\n","\n","11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code depending on certain conditions (if, elif, else).\n","\n","\n","12.How does the elif statement work?\n","elif stands for \"else if\". It lets you check multiple conditions after an initial if.\n","Only the first True block is executed.\n","x = 20\n","if x < 10:\n","    print(\"Less than 10\")\n","elif x < 30:\n","    print(\"Less than 30\")  # Executes this\n","else:\n","    print(\"30 or more\")\n","\n","13.What is the difference between for and while loops\n","\n","for: used when you know how many times to loop (e.g., looping over a list or range).\n","\n","while: used when you don't know how many times beforehand — it runs until a condition is False.\n","\n","14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","When waiting for user input or a sensor reading to meet a condition\n","password = \"\"\n","while password != \"admin\":\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","print(\"Access granted.\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OqFNW4PTuT-y"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"hfHYX9RpvnwS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"bMIyAhvByMkp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["                              **Practical Questions**\n","\n","1.
